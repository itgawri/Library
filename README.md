# Library
This project aims to create a simple system for managing information about books and their authors. The project's code uses Python and operates on data related to three books: "Hamlet" by William Shakespeare, "The Martian Chronicles" by Ray Bradbury, and "Fahrenheit 451," also by Ray Bradbury.

The project initializes information about each of these books, such as the author, genre, and publication year, and then stores this data in the form of a dictionary called my_books. Users can add new books to the library, which is visible in the code when adding information about "Fahrenheit 451."

The project also collects the authors of all books in the my_books_authors set, allowing for easy checking of whether a particular author is already in the library. In the final code snippet, we check if the author "Ray Bradbury" belongs to the set of authors, which is confirmed by displaying the relevant message.

This project can serve as a simple example for learning the basics of Python and data operations using dictionaries and sets.
